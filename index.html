			<h1>My Weekend</h1>

			<p>
				On Friday, I stayed home and played videogames. Specifically, The Witcher 3. <img class="witcher" src="http://www.keepcalmgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Witcher4-800x400.jpg">

				Then on Saturday, I went up to my family country house in upstate New York. It was a two hour drive up, which felt much longer than it actually was as my baby brother was very annoying at times. When we arrived I immediately went upstairs and set up my room. Since it was raining all day we decided to stay inside and watch Buddymoon on our monitor. <img class="house" src="Images/IMG_0765.jpg">

				On Sunday, my Dad and I worked on the shed. The door was attached awkwardly to the door frame so we decided to fix it and add new locks to the door. By the time we finished it was time to go so we ate lunch and headed back. Luckly, my brother and I were able to fall asleep so the car drive home was calm and relaxing.
